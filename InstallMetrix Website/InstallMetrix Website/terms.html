InstallMetrix<em>&nbsp;</em>may<em>&nbsp;</em>withhold<em>&nbsp;</em>a  relevant portion of any Payment from Publisher to offset any portion of any  Payment previously received by Publisher in respect of any matter under this  Section 4(c). Publisher understands that this may reduce the Payment owed to  Publisher. Publisher understands and agrees that InstallMetrix may offset from  any Payment any amount owed by Publisher, or any parent, subsidiary, or  affiliate of Publisher, to InstallMetrix or any parent, sibling or subsidiary  company of InstallMetrix. Publisher must notify InstallMetrix in writing within  thirty (30) days after receipt of a Payment if Publisher has any dispute  relating to such Payment (&ldquo;Payment Dispute Period&rdquo;).

This includes affiliates, online marketers, media buyers, software developers, site owners, bloggers, etc. For example, if you host a site with software downloads, we can help you earn money everytime someone downloads software from your site. If you are a software developer who wants to monetize your software while still offering it for free, we can help you. If you are an affiliate looking to promote something other than an oversaturated CPA offer, we can help you. The opportunities and possibilities are endless as an InstallMetrix publisher.</p>
